Output the results to console or file.

Create a function for rolling the dice.

Key Concepts:

Random Number Generation (Randomness)

Loops (To roll multiple dice)

Functions (The dice rolling process should be handled by a function)

File Writing (Optional) (Writing the results to a file)

Group Member 4: Statistics Tracker and/or GUI/CLI Interface
Option 1: Statistics Tracker

Responsibilities:

Track statistics during the game (e.g., average roll, most common roll, etc.).

Output statistical data, such as the average roll, most common result, or highest/lowest roll.

Key Concepts:

Arrays and Frequency Counters (To track statistics)

Basic Statistics Calculations (Averages, modes, etc.)

Option 2: GUI/CLI Interface

Responsibilities:

Develop a user-friendly interface (either CLI or GUI) to run the game.

Players can start the game, input the number of rounds, and see the result at the end.

For GUI, a graphical window with buttons and results, or for CLI, a text-based menu system.

Key Concepts:

User Interface (CLI or GUI) (Designing the game interface)

Data Input and Output (Getting input from the user and displaying results)

Integration:

File-Based: Each program writes/reads from a shared file.

Function-Based: If combined into one project, each student writes a module/class that interacts with others.

Command-Line: Programs can pass data via command-line arguments or standard input/output.
